Slide 3: What is DuckDB?
Title: What is DuckDB?
Content:
Overview:
DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) database management system.
Design Goals:
Designed for efficient analytical queries.
Aims to provide high performance with minimal setup.
Open-Source:
Licensed under the MIT license, allowing free use and modification.
Usage Context:
Ideal for data analysis, machine learning, and other data-intensive tasks.
       
Slide 4: Key Features
Title: Key Features
Content:
In-Process Execution:
Runs within the host process, eliminating the need for client-server communication.
Lightweight:
Minimal dependencies and easy to deploy.
SQL-92 Standard Support:
Comprehensive support for standard SQL queries.
High Performance:
Optimized for complex analytical queries and large datasets.
Cross-Platform:
Available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Efficient Data Import/Export:
Supports CSV, Parquet, and other common formats.
       
Slide 5: Architecture
Title: Architecture
Content:
In-Process Design:
Runs within the same process as the application, providing low-latency access to data.
Columnar Storage Format:
Organizes data by columns rather than rows, optimizing for read-heavy analytical workloads.
Vectorized Execution Engine:
Processes data in batches, leveraging modern CPU architectures for efficient execution.
Parallel Execution:
Utilizes multiple CPU cores to perform parallel query execution, improving performance on multi-core systems.
       
Slide 6: Performance Comparison
Title: Performance Comparison
Content:
Comparison with SQLite:
DuckDB is designed for analytical workloads, while SQLite is optimized for transactional workloads.
Benchmarks:
Typical analytical queries (e.g., aggregations, joins) show significant performance improvements over traditional row-based databases.
Resource Efficiency:
Lower memory and CPU usage for large datasets compared to many traditional databases.
       
Slide 7: Use Cases
Title: Use Cases
Content:
Embedded Analytics:
Integrate directly within applications to provide real-time analytics.
Data Science and Machine Learning:
Efficiently process and analyze large datasets for model training and evaluation.
Interactive Data Analysis:
Use with tools like Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
ETL Processes:
Perform extract, transform, load operations efficiently.
Ad-Hoc Querying:
Quickly run complex queries without the need for extensive setup.
