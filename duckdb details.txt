Efficient for data transformation and loading operations.
Slide 7: Advantages of DuckDB
High Performance:
Fast query execution with low latency.
Simplicity:
Easy to install and use with minimal configuration.
Flexibility:
Works well with various data formats (CSV, Parquet, etc.) and integrates with different programming languages (Python, R, etc.).
Scalability:
Capable of handling large datasets in-memory.
Slide 8: Limitations of DuckDB
Memory Dependency:
Performance heavily depends on available memory.
Single Process Limitation:
Designed for single-node execution, not suitable for distributed systems.
Still Evolving:
Newer compared to other established databases, so the ecosystem and community are smaller.
Slide 9: Summary
Recap:
DuckDB is a powerful in-process analytical database.
Ideal for fast, efficient data analysis and processing within applications.
Offers many advantages, though it has some limitations primarily related to its in-memory nature and single-process design.
